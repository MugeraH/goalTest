Appmodule
-  This root module acts as the application's main entry point. What this means is that all the other modules must be imported to the root module for them to work. Remember, without the root module, your application will not work.


Decorators 
-- are functions that modify JavaScript classes
--  Decorators are basically used for attaching metadata to classes so that, it knows the configuration of those classes and how they should work. Hence NgModule is a decorator function that takes metadata objects whose properties describe the module.

components
